# Alarm-System
A simple alarm system prototyped on a microcontroller includes a lock/unlock feature with password input, an alarm siren, and a temperature monitor. Built for a computer architecture course where I learned about: microprocessors and their general architecture, CISC and RISC architectures, Microcontrollers, Embedded systems, Designing computers using microprocessors, Introduction to computer hardware software codesign.

## Built With
The alarm system was built using:
* C
* Assembly
* Motorola 68HC12 Dragon 12 Microcontroller

## Features
The following are some features implemented, use cases of such features, and a number to match to the hardware diagram to give a better understanding of the project:

1. LCD Display
Display messages to User
2. 7 Segment Display
3. Alarm with Lock & Unlock Feature
4. Keypad for PIN
5. Temperature Monitor
